# whawty.groups storage schema

The whawty.groups store consists of a directory structure which stores
group membership and user meta data in files and symlinks.
The directory structure looks like this (path names are relative to the
base directory:

    users/
      username        ; yaml(?) file which contains user meta data:
      nicoo           ;   firstname, lastname, mail, ....
      equinox         ;
      fredl           ;
    groups/
      groupa/
        equinox.user  ; symlink to user file in users directory
        nicoo.user    ; symlink to user file in users directory
      groupb/
        groupa.group  ; symlink to group directory
        fredl.user    ; symlink to user file in users directory

Usernames must only contain the following characters: [-_.@A-Za-z0-9]

A whawty.groups agent must be configurable to add an implicit group for
any username. Only the user which has the same name as this group should
be a member of that group.
This membership information must not be stored in the directory but be
generated for group membershop queries.
